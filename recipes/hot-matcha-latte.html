      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>You Will Need:
        <li>One Half Teaspoon of Ceremonial Grade Matcha</li>
        <li>Cold Water</li>
        <li>Hot or Boiling Water - 80c is preferred</li>
        <li>250ml of Your Milk or Milk Alternative</li>

    </p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place your half teaspoon of matcha in a bowl with high sides (a cereal bowl will do).</li>
        <li>Add a splash, approximately 25ml of your <strong>COLD</strong> water to the bowl. Whisk over this so that your matcha is covered in water.</li>
        <li>Add approximately 75ml of your <strong>HOT OR BOILING</strong> water to the bowl. Whisk this thoroughly in an 'M' motion, preferably with a chasen (traditional matcha bamboo whisk)</li>
        <li>Now it is time to whisk in your 10ml of vanilla syrup for taste if you prefer vanilla matcha.</li>
        <li>Pour your matcha into a milk jug and top off with your milk or milk alternative!</li>
        <li>Steam to approximately 70 degrees celsius and make nice and foamy!</li>
        <li>Pour into your mug and appreciate your hard work.</li>
        <li><b>Alternatively:</b> if you do not have a milk steamer, after <b>Step 4</b> straight into a mug and microwave in 10 second intervals until you reach the desired temperature!</li>
        <li><b>Enjoy!</b></li>
      </ol>
