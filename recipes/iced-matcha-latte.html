      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>You Will Need:
        <li>One Half Teaspoon of Ceremonial Grade Matcha</li>
        <li>Cold Water</li>
        <li>Hot or Boiling Water - 80c is preferred</li>
        <li>250ml of Your Milk or Milk Alternative</li>
        <li><b>OPTIONAL:</b> Vanilla Syrup to Taste</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place your half teaspoon of matcha in a bowl with high sides (a cereal bowl will do).</li>
        <li>Add a splash, approximately 25ml of your <strong>COLD</strong> water to the bowl. Whisk over this so that your matcha is covered in water.</li>
        <li>Add approximately 75ml of your <strong>HOT OR BOILING</strong> water to the bowl. Whisk this thoroughly in an 'M' motion, preferably with a chasen (traditional matcha bamboo whisk)</li>
        <li>Now it is time to whisk in your 10ml of vanilla syrup for taste if you prefer vanilla matcha.</li>
        <li>Pour your matcha into a cocktail shaker filled with ice and <i>shake, shake, shake baby!</i></li>
        <li>Strain out the ice cubes so that you are left with a ice cold matcha shot.</li>
        <li>Fill your glass with your milk (or milk alternative) and ice ready to pour your iced matcha on top!</li>
        <li>For a gradient affect, pour your matcha over the ice cubes very slowly.</li>
        <li><b>Enjoy!</b></li>
      </ol>
